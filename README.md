# CEMA-DATA-SCIENCE-ASSIGNMENT

This repository contains the work for my CEMA Data Science assignment. The project focuses on analyzing and reporting data using R and R Markdown.

## Contents

- `J.Kahungu.html`: The final report output in HTML format.
- `.gitignore`: Standard R project ignore settings.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open the `J.Kahungu.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Knit the document to generate the HTML report.
